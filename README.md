# Enterprise Contract Configuration Files

This repo contains a set of `policy.yaml` files which can be used by the [Enterprise Contract
Command Line Interface](https://github.com/enterprise-contract/ec-cli) with a variety of
environments.

## Konflux CI

When using Red Hat's [Konflux CI](https://github.com/konflux-ci/), (formerly
[Red Hat App Studio](https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/)),
environment, there is a predefined Integration Test pipeline definition for each of the configs in
this section. They can be used when creating an Integration Test in Konflux as per the [documentation
here](https://redhat-appstudio.github.io/docs.appstudio.io/Documentation/main/how-to-guides/proc_managing-compliance-with-the-enterprise-contract/).

The policy configuration files are:

### Default

Includes rules for levels 1, 2 & 3 of SLSA v0.1. This is the default config used for new Konflux applications.

* Collections: [@slsa3](https://enterprisecontract.dev/docs/ec-policies/release_policy.html#slsa3)
* Konflux Integration Test pipeline definition:
  * Github URL: `https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/build-definitions`
  * Path in repository: [`pipelines/enterprise-contract.yaml`](https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/build-definitions/blob/main/pipelines/enterprise-contract.yaml)

### Everything (experimental)

Include every rule in the default policy source. For experiments only. This is not expected to pass for Konflux builds without excluding some rules.

* URL for Enterprise Contract: `github.com/enterprise-contract/config//everything`
* Source: [everything/policy.yaml](https://github.com/enterprise-contract/config/blob/main/everything/policy.yaml)

  * Path in repository: [`pipelines/enterprise-contract-redhat.yaml`](https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/build-definitions/blob/main/pipelines/enterprise-contract-redhat.yaml)

### Red Hat (non hermetic)

Includes most of the rules and policies required internally by Red Hat when building Red Hat products. It excludes the requirement of hermetic builds.

* URL for Enterprise Contract: `github.com/enterprise-contract/config//redhat-no-hermetic`

### SLSA3

Rules specifically related to levels 1, 2 & 3 of SLSA v0.1, plus a set of basic checks that are expected to pass for all Konflux builds.

* URL for Enterprise Contract: `github.com/enterprise-contract/config//slsa3`
* Source: [slsa3/policy.yaml](https://github.com/enterprise-contract/config/blob/main/slsa3/policy.yaml)

  * Path in repository: [`pipelines/enterprise-contract-slsa3.yaml`](https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/build-definitions/blob/main/pipelines/enterprise-contract-slsa3.yaml)


## Konflux CI & Red Hat Trusted Application Pipeline (RHTAP) - Tasks

These are policy rules used to verify Tekton Task definitions meet the Red Hat guidelines for being
considered trusted.

The policy configuration files are:

### Red Hat Trusted Tasks

Rules used to verify Tekton Task definitions comply to Red Hat's standards.
